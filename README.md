# Bill_Calculator
This simple application was created to calculate the electricity consumption of one electric meter connected to two apartments, and one bill of consumption. This application calculates the real consumption of each of the apartments separately by entering the actual readings from each breaker. Then the amount of consumption (watts) is calculated for each consumer separately, then it is calculated in the electric tariff of 0.18 halala and the VAT is calculated at 15%.

When there are two apartments that work on one bill, in most cases each resident pays 50% of the bill, regardless of the level and amount of real consumption.

But with this simple application, it can be avoided, so that if there are two apartments working on one bill, then using this application you can know the real consumption value of each apartment, then the resident pays the money registered on it only.
